# First Website

This is the empty repo for the first website we'll create in Intro to CS this year.

> Readme files (like this page) are meant to be descriptive about the project. They are NOT written in HTML, this is a language called [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

> You'll notice some blank files in this repo that we'll use to build things and practice. Feel free to add more as necessary and customize everything here.
